# LITTLEVILLAGE
A Game About A Little Village

Written with ncurses and lua(5.2)
Small game which references a word database (word2.txt)
generates random words to be typed

each word completed give you one experience point
after each level it reads a line from (poem.txt)
after completing level 5 you get a end screen from (story.txt)

The gameplay itself is pretty good,
I decided one morning after a week of trying to develop an rpg style game
to implement a more skill oriented style of gameplay,
I created Little Village implementing my recent knowledge of ncurses
and (re)learning the basics of lua which is displayed in that all the content is rewritable

Type the messages in order as they appear, and press enter after each.
Have fun!  (PS. its really easy, just get to level 6 and you will win)
