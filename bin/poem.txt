words of a man from the vilage with nothing left but fear and despair
a prose of indignation and lost hope
where the wildest nightly dreams have left no bounds to the imagination
great spirits dwells in the darkest of monsters never seen for eon
weary of the agony of befortune
where battletorn armoury cease efficiency
and the dragon successful; the vilage lay captive to mallicious desire
